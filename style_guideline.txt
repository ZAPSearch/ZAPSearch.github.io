Overall Look and Feel of ZAPSearch
___________________________________

The overall look and feel of our website should be sleek and mild. We will avoid "loud" colours and overwhelming animations/features. 



Colours
________

We are presently trying out many shades of blue-ish grey-ish (with the equivalent complementary colours) for the main colour scheme of our website. They are very neutral colours that mesh well together. Again, nothing too overwhelming.

Our colour scheme will be very similar to :

- #1F2C3C
- #FFFFFF
- #A3BCDA
- #8D774E
- #DAC6A3



Iconography
____________

To stay consistant with our sleek design, elements incorporated into the website will be square and flat, (ex: tables, titles, etc.). No 3D.


Typography
___________

We are currently planning on using : Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif (safe font)



Links
______

Links will have no decoration, change colour when hovered over and hopefully have an added "animation" (coloured bar over top) also when hovered over.



Buttons
________
As mentioned above, buttons will be flat and square, and most likely be one of the darker shades of colours established.
